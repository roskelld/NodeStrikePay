## Thanks 

Big thanks to [Arc](https://github.com/arcbtc) for pioneering this route with [1.21](https://github.com/arcbtc/1.21) it was a great reference point for figuring out the code. I hit some brick walls with my setup (first time working with the hardware and Arduino) so finding 1.21 gave me something to reference.
